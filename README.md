Grade Calculator Website is a program that calculates the average grade for a class by the user inputting major and minor grades and weights for each. I made this project using HTML and CSS. I already made a Java Grade Calculator 
and I wanted to make a grade calculator using my web dev skills. I struggled with finding a way to calculate the grades and output them, as that is used more in JS.
